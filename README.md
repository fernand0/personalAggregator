This site is a personal aggregator and it is developped with jekyll-pages. It neds:

* The program generating the posts: [personalAggregator.py](https://github.com/fernand0/scripts/blob/master/personalAggregator.py) 
   * It runs on local (pending integration with actions or something similar).
   * It needs the project [socialModules](https://github.com/fernand0/socialModules/) in order to get information from RSS and other sources
* This jekyll site
   * The template has been generated tweaking Mozilla Foundation [Solo]](https://soloist.ai/) generated code. You can see the original at [elmundoesimperfecto at soloist](https://soloist.ai/elmundoesimperfecto)

Demo: [ElMundoEsImperfecto](https://elmundoesimperfecto.com)
